# Hello world, I'm Tris ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm an audio hacker, python developer, and musician based in London. I currently work for the UK's [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov/), and by night I [write electronic music](https://namtao.com) and produce a scifi podcast called [Lost Terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3bDE9kszMc&list=PL95NP4bDITAln7fq-cCqzOFE15UvVthuL&index=2&t=0s), exploring themes of near-future AI which blends my three great passions of music, programming, and love of my own voice - check it out!
