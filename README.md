# Hi there, I'm Tris ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm an audio hacker, python developer, and musician based in London. I currently work for the UK's [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov/), and by night I produce a podcast blending my music, programming and love of my own voice called [Lost Terminal](https://twitter.com/namtaomusic/status/1283010289168982016), check it out!
