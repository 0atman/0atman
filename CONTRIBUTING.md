# Hi I'm Tris. ðŸ‘‹

I work in the [GOV.UK Forms](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/forms) team from my home in south London.

This is my _personal readme_, sometimes called a _runbook_, or a _manual for me_. If you're reading this, we're probably working together, and I'd like to make that process as great as possible!

## Working together

You will find me [very direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) in my speech and plans. I write code to solve problems, and anything that is not writing code I see as an overhead. Many overheads, such as research and documentation are necessary, but I am hyper-aware that we're here to build a product, not beautiful meeting minutes. 

I dislike solving the same problems that others have, or talking a lot with no clear goals.
## The best way to give me feedback

I am **very** receptive to feedback. I change my mind when presented with evidence. I will thank you genuinely when given clear, targeted feedback.

## My best working patterns

Online, async, Monday-Wednesday, 9-5. I am delighted to meet with my collagues in-person once per sprint for planning, lunch, more planning, and after-work drinks.

## When I'm dealing with stress

I don't typically have any issues with stress. I am very good at compartmentalisation, and don't let difficulties in some task affect others.

## My absolute requirements to do great work

I like to work in an agile environment, where I deliver incremental software features into production many times a week.

## Beyond work, Iâ€™m really passionate about

Playing music and tabletop games with friends, I also write and produce fiction podcasts! ([Lost Terminal](https://www.lostterminal.com/) & [Modem Prometheus](https://www.modemprometheus.com/))

Thanks for reading!
