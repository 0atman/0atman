Hi I'm Tris. ðŸ‘‹ I work in the GDS GOV.UK Forms team, from my house in south London.

This is a personal readme, sometimes called a [Manual For Me](https://www.manualof.me). If you're reading this, you're working with me, and I'd like to make that process as great as possible!


## The best way to give me feedback

I am very receptive to feedback. I change my mind when presented with evidence. I will thank you genuinely when given clear, targeted feedback.

## Beyond work, Iâ€™m really passionate about

Jamming with friends, writing and producing fiction podcasts, playing tabletop games with my friends!

## My best working patterns

Online, async,Monday-Wednesday 9-5

## When I'm dealing with stress

I don't typically have any issues with stress. I am very good at compartmentalisation, and don't let difficulties in some task affect others.

## My absolute requirements to do great work

I like to work in an agile environment, where I deliver incremental features on software into production many times a week.

## Working together

You will find me very direct in my speech and plans. I write code to solve problems, and anything that is not writing code I see as an overhead. Many overheads, such as research and documentation are neciessary, but I am hyper aware that we're here to build a product. 

I dislike solving the same problems that others have, or talking a lot with no clear goals.
